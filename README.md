## TeamCity Minimal Agent Image Dockerfile

This project contains the Dockerfiles and all necessary scripts to build the Linux and Windows Docker images and run a TeamCity Build Agent inside the container.

You can pull the ready-to-use image from the Docker Hub repository
                                     
`docker pull jetbrains/teamcity-minimal-agent`

If you need to build your own image, you need to perform the following:

1) Pull our base image and re-tag it 
```
docker pull jetbrains/teamcity-base
docker tag jetbrains/teamcity-base teamcity-base
```
You can use your own base image with the operation system of your choice and JAVA installed. TeamCity relies on the `JRE_HOME` environment variable. Just tag your own image with the `teamcity-base` tag.

2) On Unix extract `buildAgent.zip` of any version you'd like to use into  the `dist/buildagent` folder and prepare agent config directory. In the same directory where the Dockerfile is placed, run
```
mkdir dist
unzip buildAgent.zip -d dist/buildagent
mv dist/buildagent/conf dist/buildagent/conf_dist
```

On Windows just put `buildAgent.zip` into the repository root.

3) Run the `docker build` command:
```
docker build -t teamcity-minimal-agent
```

See our [detailed instructions] (https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-minimal-agent/) on how to use the image in the Docker Hub repository .
